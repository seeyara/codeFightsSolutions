Find some amateur code to codefights problems

CodeFights is one of my favourite sites to learn coding and it has taught me speed-coding, coding under pressure and solving problems i wouldnt have done otehrwise. 
The interface is amazing and i really racked my brains for some of the problems. I hope you find what youre looking for :)
